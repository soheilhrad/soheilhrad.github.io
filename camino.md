lede: "An offline Spanish tutor for absolute beginners. Twenty-five lessons, a year in Salamanca, and someone to speak Spanish with."
decision: "When the model cannot be relied on to produce something, the app produces it instead: conjugations, exercise marking and which language to explain in all come from code, not from the model."
